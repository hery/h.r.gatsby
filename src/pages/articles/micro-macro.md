title: "On the Balance of Micro and Macro"

Lately, I've been obsessed with the balance between micro- and macro-thinking across various domains.
It's a concept that occurs everywhere in the world, think of micro- and macro-economics, micro- and macro-management,
or physics at the micro- and macro-level, i.e. the invisible and visible respectively.
Throughout this article, I'll be referring to them simply as micro and macro.

My first explicit encounter with that concept occured as I was trying to improve at a game called League of Legends.

***basic explication of the game, macro across 3 lanes, micro over 1 lane***

Roughly, one should first become acquainted with mechanical dexterity in order to gain control over a small part of the game (micro), and then learn how to transfer that advantage to the rest of the game (macro).

In my current mental representation of the balance between micro- and macro-thinking, it is acceptable to initially focus solely on the micro. However, once one gains a good enough understanding of the micro, by reaching a learning plateau for example, it is then a good time to shift focus to the macro. I'm no physics expert, though, so don't apply anything of what you read here to that domain.

It's now been a few years since I started practicing yoga, and I've seen my practice constantly evolve over time.
What seems to consistently change is where my focus is during practice.

As far as I remember, during my early days, I would focus on trying to *achieve* poses, particularly the impressive ones.
Trying to look good achieving poses is as micro as it gets. You don't really know why you're doing them, but you do them anyway.
As I was getting better at the micro-level of yoga poses, I started learning about and feeling the macro, i.e why do I keep doing these poses, and why do I keep coming back to my mat?

Yoga isn't about getting strong and looking good. Some say the hardest pose in Power Yoga/Vinyasa is savasana, also known as corpse pose.
It occurs at the end of each flow. To do it, a yogi must simply lie down on her back, and stay still. Easy enough, isn't it? 
However, the hard part of savasana is not to still the body, but to still the mind. To not think about anything and be there. It can actually be incredibly challenging, because there is so much going on in our lives.

I believe this is why yoga, at least its vinyasa style, is physically challenging to begin with.
The more physically challenging a flow is, the more physically exhausted it makes a yogi, and hopefully, the stiller her mind will be.
And that is the beauty of yoga. It's accessible to all, in the way poses have variations of progressive intensity, which exhaust yogis regardless of their levels.

***pictures of position variations***

To sum up these last few paragraphs, at a micro level, a yogi focuses on positions, and at a macro level, a yogi focuses on the entire flow, managing her energy to reach the best state for savasana.

At the intersection of micro and micro, another essential part of yoga, without which I find getting through a vinyasa flow incredibly hard is breathing. What makes vinyasa really fun is that each movement needs to be synchronized with either an inhale or an exhale.  
Get one wrong and you'll be struggling to find your breath. Don't breath and you'll be struggling to do anything at all.  
A common breathing technique in vinyasa is the mujai breath, which lets a yogi keep her energy within throughout a flow.  

> Ujjayi is a diaphragmatic breath, which first fills the lower belly (activating the first and second chakras), rises to the lower rib cage (the third and fourth chakras), and finally moves into the upper chest and throat. Inhalation and exhalation are both done through the nose. The "ocean sound" is created by moving the glottis as air passes in and out.

Uujayi breath is in itself advanced micro. It is a How. But knowing why practicing Uujayi breath at all is macro, i.e. a Why.
You need to look foward in time. You do the first sun salutations to build energy, and it's really easy not to breath through those
if just ignore your energy flows. But if you practice Uujayi breath even through the easy poses, you get to store the energy 
you build up doing them, and when you do get to more advanced parts of the flow, you'll be much readier and stronger to do those harder poses.

To conclude, it's worth repeating that the balance of micromanagement and macromanagement is present in every area of life.
At that scale, it becomes the question of how I'm diong something vs why I am doing it. Short-term vs long-term. 
On the one hand, not being macro-aware at all is dangerous, because you might wake up day wondering *why* you even did all those things you did so well. On the other hand, life is to be lived. If you keep wondering why you're doing things, you might just not do anything at all.

So as Nike says, 

> Just do It!

Another way to look at it, is that as Ghandi said,

> Whatever you do in life will be insignificant, but it's very important that you do it, because nobody else will.

So while our actions might affect our entire lives and everyone around us, ultimately, we're only ephemeral beings and they're indeed probably insignificant. So while wondering why from time to time can help us do the "right" thing, we should not forget to embrace the how and now, and just do whatever is it we're doing while giving it all our attention and focus.
